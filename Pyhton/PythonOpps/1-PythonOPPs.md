- Allows you to **structure your code** using **classes and objects**.

## âœ… Advantages of OOP

- Provides a **clear structure** to programs
- Makes code easier to **maintain**, **reuse**, and **debug**
- Helps keep your code **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Allows you to build **reusable applications** with **less code**

> ğŸ’¡ **Tip:**

## ğŸ§± What are Classes and Objects?

- **Classes** and **Objects** are the **core concepts** in OOP.

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Class**  | Blueprint/template of what an object should be |
| **Object** | Instance of a class; real-world entity with data and behavior |

## ğŸ§ª Real-Life Examples

| Class | Objects |
|-------|---------|
| `Fruit` | Apple, Banana, Mango |
| `Car`   | Volvo, Audi, Toyota |

> ğŸ“Œ When you create an **object** from a **class**, it inherits all the **variables** and **functions** defined inside that class.
