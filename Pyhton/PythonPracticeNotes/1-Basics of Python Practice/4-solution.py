# ✅ Problem 1: Add Comments to Explain Code

# Assign 10 to variable x
x = 10

# Assign 5 to variable y
y = 5

# Add x and y and store the result in z
z = x + y

# Print the result
print("Problem 1 Output:", z)  # Output: 15


# ✅ Problem 2: Use Comments to Disable Code

# This program prints your name and age
print("Rajan Sharma")

# Temporarily disabling age line while testing
# print("Age: 24")


# ✅ Problem 3: Write a Multi-line Comment (Docstring Style)

"""

length = 10
width = 5
area = length * width
print("Problem 3 Output - Area of rectangle:", area)  # Output: 50


# ✅ Problem 4: Comment Out Faulty Code

x = "Hello"

# Incorrect function, commenting out to avoid error
# printx(x)

# Correct function
print("Problem 4 Output:", x)  # Output: Hello


# ✅ Problem 5: Documentation Practice

# This program adds two numbers

"""
Takes two hardcoded numbers,
adds them, and prints the result
