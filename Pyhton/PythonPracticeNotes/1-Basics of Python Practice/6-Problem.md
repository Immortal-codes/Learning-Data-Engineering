# ðŸ“¤ Python Output Variables â€“ Practice Problems

These problems will help you master the use of the `print()` function and how to handle variables in output, especially when combining strings and numbers.

---

## âœ… Problem 1: Print a Single Variable

**Task:**  
Create a variable `msg = "Python is powerful"` and print it using `print()`.

---

## âœ… Problem 2: Concatenate Three Strings

**Task:**  
Create three variables:  
```python
x = "Python "
y = "is "
z = "awesome"
```  
Now print them together as one sentence using the `+` operator.

## âœ… Problem 3: Concatenate String and Integer (With Error Fix)

**Task:**  
Write the following code and fix the error using type conversion:

```python
age = 24
print("I am " + age + " years old")
```

---

## âœ… Problem 4: Print Name and Age in One Line

**Task:**  
Declare:
```python
name = "Rajan"
age = 24
```
Print:  
```
My name is Rajan and I am 24 years old.
```

Use **string concatenation** with type conversion.

---

## âœ… Problem 5: Combine Words and Numbers

**Task:**  
Create a simple math output like this:

```python
a = 5
b = 3
```

Expected Output:  
```
The sum of 5 and 3 is 8.
```

Hint: Use `str()` or `f-strings` to convert and print.

---

ðŸ§  Tip:
- Use `str()` to convert numbers to strings before concatenating.
- You can also use **f-strings** or **comma-separated print** for cleaner output.

Let me know if you want `.py` code solutions too!
