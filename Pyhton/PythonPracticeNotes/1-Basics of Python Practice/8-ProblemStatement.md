# 🔠 Python Built-in Data Types – Practice Problems

These problems will help you understand how to use and identify Python's built-in data types. Use `type()` wherever needed.

---

## 🔤 Text Type (`str`)

### ✅ Problem 1:
Create a variable with your full name and print its type.

### ✅ Problem 2:
Concatenate two string variables and print the result.

---

## 🔢 Numeric Types (`int`, `float`, `complex`)

### ✅ Problem 3:
Assign your age to an `int`, height to a `float`, and create a complex number. Print each and its type.

### ✅ Problem 4:
Perform arithmetic operations with int and float types and print the result and type.

---

## 🔁 Sequence Types (`list`, `tuple`, `range`)

### ✅ Problem 5:
Create a list of 3 fruits and print the first element and its type.

### ✅ Problem 6:
Create a tuple of 3 numbers and print its length using `len()`.

### ✅ Problem 7:
Create a range from 1 to 10 and convert it to a list. Print the list.

---

## 🔁 Mapping Type (`dict`)

### ✅ Problem 8:
Create a dictionary with keys `name`, `age`, `language`. Print the value of `language`.

---

## 🔘 Set Types (`set`, `frozenset`)

### ✅ Problem 9:
Create a set of 3 unique cities and print its type.

### ✅ Problem 10:
Convert a list to a `frozenset` and print it.

---

## ✅ Boolean Type (`bool`)

### ✅ Problem 11:
Write a condition that checks if age is greater than 18 and store the result in a boolean variable. Print the result and its type.

---

## 💾 Binary Types (`bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`)

### ✅ Problem 12:
Create a `bytes` object with the word "Python" and print it.

### ✅ Problem 13:
Create a `bytearray` of size 5 and print the default values.

### ✅ Problem 14:
Use `memoryview` on a byte object and print the result.

---

## ❌ None Type (`NoneType`)

### ✅ Problem 15:
Create a variable `x = None`. Print its value and type.

---

🧠 **Reminder:**  
Use `print(type(variable))` to check the type.
