# ðŸ“˜ Python Basics â€“ Practice from Intro Paragraph

These problems are based on understanding and manipulating strings, fixing typos, formatting text, and storing info using variables/lists â€” all inspired by the paragraph you wrote.

---

## âœ… Problem 1: Fix the Paragraph Typos

**Task:**  
Store the paragraph in a variable and fix the following typos using `.replace()`:

- `"Languae"` â†’ `"Language"`
- `"creatre"` â†’ `"create"`
- `"mathmatics"` â†’ `"mathematics"`
- `"protoyping"` â†’ `"prototyping"`
- `"pyton"` â†’ `"Python"`

**Hint:** Use multiple `.replace()` calls.

## âœ… Problem 2: Count Keyword Occurrences

**Task:**  
Using the same paragraph, count how many times the word `"Python"` or `"python"` appears (case-insensitive).

**Expected Output:**
```
'Python' appears 3 times in the paragraph.
```

## âœ… Problem 3: Extract All Use-Cases from Paragraph

**Task:**  
Print each use-case (after "python is used to:-") as a bullet list.

**Expected Output:**
```
Python is used for:
- web development
- software development
- mathematics
- system scripting
- create server side of web applications
- alongside software to create workflows
- used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics
- used for rapid prototyping
```

## âœ… Problem 4: Create a Python Uses List

**Task:**  
Store all the Python use-cases in a `list` and print them one by one using a loop.

**Hint:** You can either hardcode the list or extract it from the paragraph.

## âœ… Problem 5: Print a Clean Summary

**Task:**  
Print the following structured summary using formatted string and variables:

**Expected Output:**
```
Python is a Popular programming Language.
It is used to:
â†’ Develop websites
â†’ Build software
â†’ Handle big data
â†’ Automate workflows
â†’ Perform complex mathematics
â†’ Create prototypes quickly
Python's syntax is simple like English.
```
