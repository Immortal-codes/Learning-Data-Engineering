# 🧱 Python Syntax & Indentation – Practice Problems

These problems will help you understand how Python uses **syntax rules** and **indentation** to define code blocks — unlike other languages where indentation is optional.

---

## ✅ Problem 1: Simple If Condition with Correct Indentation

**Task:**  
Write a program to check if a number is positive, and print a message using proper indentation.

```python
# Expected Output:
# The number is positive
```

---

## ✅ Problem 2: Fix the Indentation Error

**Task:**  
The following code has incorrect indentation. Rewrite it correctly.

```python
if 10 > 3:
print("10 is greater than 3")
    print("This line has wrong indentation")
```

---

## ✅ Problem 3: Use Consistent Indentation in If-Else Block

**Task:**  
Write a program to check if a user is an adult (age >= 18). Use **consistent 2-space or 4-space** indentation across all blocks.

**Expected Output:**
```
Enter your age: 21
You are an adult.
```

## ✅ Problem 4: Check Syntax Error (Manually)

**Task:**  
The following code will cause a syntax error. Identify the reason and correct it.

```python
if 7 > 2:
  print("7 is greater")
    print("Still greater")
```

---

## ✅ Problem 5: Nested If with Proper Indentation

**Task:**  
Write a nested `if` condition properly indented:

```python
x = 10

# If x > 5, print "x is big"
# If x > 8, print "x is very big"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
x is big
x is very big
```

🔁 **Bonus Tip:**  
You can test all indentation-related syntax errors directly in Python's interactive shell or save as `.py` files to observe behavior.

Happy Coding! 🧠✨
