# üí¨ Python Comments ‚Äì Practice Problems

These problems will help you practice how to use **single-line** and **multi-line comments** effectively in Python. Comments make your code clean, readable, and easier to debug or document.

## ‚úÖ Problem 1: Add Comments to Explain Code

**Task:**  
Given the following code, rewrite it by adding meaningful **single-line comments** that explain each step:

```python
x = 10
y = 5
z = x + y
print(z)
```

---

## ‚úÖ Problem 2: Use Comments to Disable Code

**Task:**  
Write a simple program that prints your name and age. Then, comment out the age print line (to simulate testing).

**Example:**
```python
print("Rajan Sharma")
# print("Age: 24")
```

---

## ‚úÖ Problem 3: Write a Multi-line Comment (Docstring Style)

**Task:**  
At the top of your Python file, write a multi-line comment describing the purpose of the program, the author name, and the date.

**Example:**
```python
"""
Program: Area Calculator
Author: Rajan Sharma
Date: July 3, 2025
This program calculates the area of a rectangle.
"""
```

## ‚úÖ Problem 4: Comment Out Faulty Code

**Task:**  
Given this code with an error, comment out the faulty line so that the rest can run.

```python
x = "Hello"
# printx(x)   ‚Üê This line should be commented to prevent error
print(x)
```

---

## ‚úÖ Problem 5: Documentation Practice

**Task:**  
Write a program that takes two numbers and prints their sum. Write proper **documentation** using single-line and multi-line comments to explain what each part does.

**Expected Output:**
```python
# This program adds two numbers

"""
Takes input from the user,
adds the numbers, and prints the result
"""

a = 5
b = 3
print(a + b)  # Print the sum
```

---

üìù **Note:**  
- Use `#` for single-line comments.  
- Use triple quotes `"""` or `'''` for multi-line comments (though usually used as docstrings).

Happy Commenting! ‚úçÔ∏èüíª
