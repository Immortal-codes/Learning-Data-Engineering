# 🌍 Python Global Variables – Practice Problems

These problems will help you understand how **global** and **local** variables behave in Python, and how the `global` keyword affects variable scope inside functions.

## ✅ Part 1: Global Variables (Without `global` keyword)

### 🔹 Problem 1: Print a Global Variable Inside Function

**Task:**  
Create a variable `language = "Python"` outside the function. Inside the function, print `"I love Python"` using the global variable.

---

### 🔹 Problem 2: Modify a Global Variable Inside Function (Without `global`)

**Task:**  
Try to change the value of a global variable `x = 5` to `x = 10` **inside a function** without using `global`. Print `x` outside the function and observe the result.

---

### 🔹 Problem 3: Local vs Global

**Task:**  
Create a variable `name = "Rajan"` outside the function and another `name = "Sharma"` inside the function. Print both to show the difference between local and global.

---

## ✅ Part 2: Using the `global` Keyword

### 🔹 Problem 4: Create a Global Variable from Inside a Function

**Task:**  
Inside a function, use `global city` and assign a value `"Delhi"`. After calling the function, print `city` outside the function.

---

### 🔹 Problem 5: Modify Global Variable Using `global` Keyword

**Task:**  
Create a global variable `count = 0`.  
Inside a function, use `global count` and increment it by 1.  
Call the function twice and print `count`.

🧠 **Bonus Questions (Optional for Deep Understanding):**

- What happens if you try to read a global variable before declaring it using `global` inside a function?
- Why is it risky to overuse global variables in large applications?
