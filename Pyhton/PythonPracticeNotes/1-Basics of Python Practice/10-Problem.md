# ðŸ§ª Python Type Casting â€“ Practice Problems

## ðŸ“Œ int() â€“ Practice Problems

1. Convert user input (string) to integer and add 5 to it.
2. Write a program that takes two string numbers and returns their integer sum.
3. Convert a float to an int and show both before and after values.
4. Parse a string `"007"` to an int and print its type before and after.
5. Try to convert a non-integer string like `"hello"` to int and handle the error using `try-except`.

## ðŸ“Œ float() â€“ Practice Problems

1. Take two user inputs (string numbers) and calculate their float average.
2. Convert an int and a string `"3.14"` to float and multiply them.
3. Read a value like `"5.0"` as string, convert to float and add 2.5.
4. Check what happens if you convert `"abc"` to float (handle the error).
5. Write a function that accepts an int or float and always returns a float result.

## ðŸ“Œ str() â€“ Practice Problems

1. Convert an integer to string and print `"You are <age> years old"` using it.
2. Convert boolean values `True` and `False` to strings and print them.
3. Concatenate a string and number using casting (e.g., `"Score: "` + `str(99)`).
4. Take user name and age as input and print a greeting using str().
5. Convert float `3.14159` to string and find its length using `len()`.
