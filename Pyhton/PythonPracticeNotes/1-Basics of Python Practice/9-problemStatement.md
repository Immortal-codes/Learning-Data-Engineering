# ðŸ§  Python Numbers â€“ Practice Problems

These problems will help you solidify your understanding of numeric types in Python: `int`, `float`, and `complex`.

## ðŸ”¢ Problem 1: Assign Different Number Types

**Task:**  
Create 3 variables:
- `a = 10` as an integer  
- `b = 3.14` as a float  
- `c = 2 + 4j` as a complex number  
Print each variable and its type.

## ðŸ”¢ Problem 2: Perform Arithmetic with `int` and `float`

**Task:**  
Add, subtract, and multiply two numbers:
```python
x = 7        # int  
y = 2.5      # float
```
Print all three operations and their types.

## ðŸ”¢ Problem 3: Work with Complex Numbers

**Task:**  
Create two complex numbers:
```python
a = 3 + 2j  
b = 1 - 4j
```
Add and subtract them. Print the results and types.

## ðŸ”¢ Problem 4: Type Checking

**Task:**  
Given the values:
```python
x = 100  
y = 45.67  
z = 7j
```
Use `type()` to print the data type of each.

---

## ðŸ”¢ Problem 5: Modify and Reassign Number Types

**Task:**  
Start with:
```python
num = 5
```
Reassign `num` to:
- a float (`5.5`)
- then a complex number (`5 + 3j`)  
Print the value and type each time after reassignment.

ðŸ§  Tip:  
Use `print(type(x))` to confirm data types during experiments.
