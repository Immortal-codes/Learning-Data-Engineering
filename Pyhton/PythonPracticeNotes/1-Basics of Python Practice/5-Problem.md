# 🧠 Python Variables – Practice Problems

---

## 🔹 Part 1: What are Variables?

### ✅ Problem 1:
Declare a variable `name` and assign your full name. Print it.

### ✅ Problem 2:
Create two variables `a = 10`, `b = 5`, and print their sum.

### ✅ Problem 3:
Assign a float value to a variable `pi` and print it.

### ✅ Problem 4:
Assign your city and country to two variables and print them together in one line.

### ✅ Problem 5:
Store your age in a variable and print a message:  
`"I am 24 years old."`

## 🔹 Part 2: Variable Names & Rules

### ✅ Problem 1:
Create variables using:
- short name (`x`)
- meaningful name (`age`)
- underscore (`_balance`)

Print all three.

### ✅ Problem 2:
Check case-sensitivity:
```python
name = "Rajan"
Name = "Sharma"
print(name)
print(Name)
```

### ✅ Problem 3:
Try creating a variable with an invalid name like `2name = "invalid"`  
→ Observe the syntax error and fix it.

### ✅ Problem 4:
Make a list of 5 invalid Python variable names and explain why each is invalid in comments.

### ✅ Problem 5:
Check if `is`, `for`, `True`, and `while` can be used as variable names.  
→ Try assigning values and see what happens.

## 🔹 Part 3: Multi-Word Variable Naming

### ✅ Problem 1 (Camel Case):
Declare a variable using **camelCase**:
```python
studentAge = 21
```
Print it.

### ✅ Problem 2 (Pascal Case):
Use **PascalCase** to create a variable `StudentName` and assign your name.

### ✅ Problem 3 (Snake Case):
Use **snake_case** to create a variable `student_grade = "A"` and print it.

### ✅ Problem 4:
Declare three variables using each of the three styles and print them in one line.

### ✅ Problem 5:
Rename all your variables from snake_case to camelCase in a small program (practice refactoring).

📝 **Tips:**
- Use `type(var)` to verify variable data types.
- Follow consistent naming style in your codebase.

Happy Practicing! 🔥💻
