Strings
Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

'hello' is the same as "hello".


Quotes Inside Quotes
You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:


Multiline Strings
You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:

Example
You can use three double quotes:

a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
print(a)
