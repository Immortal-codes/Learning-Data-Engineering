# ✅ Python – Tuple Unpacking (Complete FAANG-Level Notes)

---

## 🔹 What is Tuple Unpacking?

**Unpacking** means extracting individual values from a tuple (or any iterable) and assigning them to variables in a single line.

### 🔧 Syntax:
```python
a, b = (1, 2)
````

Now `a = 1`, `b = 2`

✅ Python automatically matches the number of variables with tuple elements.

---

## 🔹 Basic Example

```python
point = (4, 5)
x, y = point
print(x, y)  # Output: 4 5
```

---

## 🔹 Without Parentheses (Pythonic)

```python
x, y = 10, 20
print(x, y)  # Output: 10 20
```

📌 Tuples don’t **require parentheses** for unpacking.

---

## 🔹 Unpacking with Functions

```python
def get_employee():
    return ("Rajan", "SDE", 25)

name, role, age = get_employee()
print(name, role, age)  # Output: Rajan SDE 25
```

📌 **Real-world use** when returning multiple values from a function.

---

## 🔹 Swapping Variables

```python
a, b = 1, 2
a, b = b, a
print(a, b)  # Output: 2 1
```

✅ Pythonic way to swap without a temp variable — **asked in interviews often.**

---

## 🔹 Nested Tuple Unpacking

```python
data = ("Rajan", (25, "SDE"))
name, (age, role) = data
print(name, age, role)  # Output: Rajan 25 SDE
```

📌 Use when unpacking tuples inside tuples (nested).

---

## 🔹 Unpacking with `*` (Starred Expression)

### 💥 Extended unpacking (Python 3.x+):

```python
a, *b = (1, 2, 3, 4)
print(a)  # 1
print(b)  # [2, 3, 4]
```

```python
*a, b = (1, 2, 3, 4)
print(a)  # [1, 2, 3]
print(b)  # 4
```

```python
a, *b, c = (1, 2, 3, 4)
print(a, b, c)  # 1 [2, 3] 4
```

📌 Useful when you want head/tail, or skip middle values flexibly.

---

## 🔹 Looping with Tuple Unpacking

```python
pairs = [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]

for num, char in pairs:
    print(num, char)
```

✅ Clean and readable way to iterate over list of tuples.

---

## 🔹 Ignore Unwanted Values (Using `_`)

```python
emp = ("Rajan", "SDE", 25, "Noida")

name, _, age, _ = emp
print(name, age)  # Output: Rajan 25
```

📌 `_` is conventionally used to **ignore variables** during unpacking.

---

## ⚠️ Errors to Avoid

| Error Type        | Example            | Fix                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| Too many values   | `a, b = (1, 2, 3)` | Use `*` unpacking    |
| Not enough values | `a, b, c = (1, 2)` | Match count properly |

---

## 🔥 Real-World Use Cases

* Returning multiple values from functions ✅
* Swapping variables ✅
* Extracting fields from a record (tuple) ✅
* Iterating over `dict.items()` or zipped lists ✅
* Splitting file paths: `head, *tail = path.split("/")` ✅

## 📌 Summary

| Feature                        | Supported |
| ------------------------------ | --------- |
| Basic Unpacking                | ✅         |
| Nested Unpacking               | ✅         |
| Starred `*` Unpacking          | ✅         |
| Ignoring values with `_`       | ✅         |
| Loop Unpacking (`for x, y in`) | ✅         |
