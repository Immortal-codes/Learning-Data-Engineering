Execute Python Syntax
As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:


Python Indentation
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")


  ython will give you an error if you skip the indentation:

Example
Syntax Error:

if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")

You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:

Example
Syntax Error:

if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!")
        print("Five is greater than two!")
