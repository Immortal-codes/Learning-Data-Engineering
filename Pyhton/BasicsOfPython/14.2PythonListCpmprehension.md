# ✅ Python – List Comprehension (🔥 Ultimate Notes)

---

## 🚀 What is List Comprehension?

List comprehension is a **shorter, cleaner, and faster** way to create lists in Python from **iterables** (like `list`, `range()`, `str`, etc).

### 🧠 Syntax:
```python
[expression for item in iterable if condition]
````

---

## 🔹 Basic Example

```python
squares = [x*x for x in range(5)]
print(squares)  # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
```

✅ *Same as:*

```python
squares = []
for x in range(5):
    squares.append(x*x)
```

---

## 🔹 With Condition

```python
evens = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
print(evens)  # [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
```

---

## 🔹 With Else (⚠️ Needs `if-else` before `for`)

```python
labels = ["Even" if x % 2 == 0 else "Odd" for x in range(5)]
print(labels)  # ['Even', 'Odd', 'Even', 'Odd', 'Even']
```

---

## 🔹 With Nested Loop

```python
pairs = [(x, y) for x in [1, 2] for y in [3, 4]]
print(pairs)  # [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)]
```

---

## 🔹 List of Strings to Uppercase

```python
names = ["alice", "bob", "charlie"]
upper_names = [name.upper() for name in names]
print(upper_names)  # ['ALICE', 'BOB', 'CHARLIE']
```

---

## 🔹 Remove Vowels from a String

```python
text = "hello world"
no_vowels = [ch for ch in text if ch.lower() not in "aeiou"]
print("".join(no_vowels))  # "hll wrld"
```

---

## 🔹 Flatten a 2D List (Matrix)

```python
matrix = [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6]]
flat = [num for row in matrix for num in row]
print(flat)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

---

## 🔹 Convert String Numbers to Int

```python
str_nums = ["1", "2", "3"]
nums = [int(x) for x in str_nums]
print(nums)  # [1, 2, 3]
```

---

## ⚡ Speed vs For Loop?

List comprehension is **faster** than normal `for` loop + `append()`.

---

## 🧠 When NOT to Use It?

* Avoid using when logic is too complex (hurts readability).
* For deeply nested loops or multiple conditions → stick to `for` loops.

## 📌 Real-World Use Cases

| Task                       | List Comprehension Example                     |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Filter even numbers        | `[x for x in nums if x % 2 == 0]`              |
| Read integers from input   | `[int(x) for x in input().split()]`            |
| Extract file extensions    | `[f.split('.')[-1] for f in filenames]`        |
| Remove stopwords from text | `[word for word in words if word not in stop]` |

✅ Clean
✅ Pythonic
✅ Fast
✅ Best for transforming/filtering data
