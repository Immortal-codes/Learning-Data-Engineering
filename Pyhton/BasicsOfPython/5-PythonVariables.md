# Python Variables

## What are Variables?
Variables are containers to store data values.

In Python, you do not need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable. Python automatically assigns the data type when you assign a value to the variable.

## Variable Names

A variable can have a short name (like `x` and `y`) or a more descriptive name (`age`, `carname`, `total_volume`).

### Rules for Python Variable Names:

- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character (`_`).
- A variable name cannot start with a number.
- A variable name can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores (`A-z`, `0-9`, and `_`).
- Variable names are case-sensitive (`age`, `Age`, and `AGE` are three different variables).
- A variable name cannot be any of the Python **keywords**.

## Multi-Word Variable Names

Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read. To improve readability, you can use the following naming conventions:

### Camel Case

Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:

```python
myVariableName = "John"
````

### Pascal Case

Each word starts with a capital letter:

```python
MyVariableName = "John"
```

### Snake Case

Each word is separated by an underscore character:

```python
my_variable_name = "John"
```

```
